# Learnings
Knowledge of everything in IT, such as programming languages, networks, security, etc.

This repository represents a collection of knowledge in various areas of IT. It contains excerpts from articles (or the articles themselves, but modified and lightened), code snippets, sample configuration files, and more.

The purpose of this - some kind of centralization and/or systematization of knowledge, which aren't used so often and than can be forgotten. For example, how often is needed to implement a binary tree? Or configure IPSec on linux using *Strongswan*? So, here will be somthing, that you can take and say "Aha! That's it!"
